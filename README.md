# Xcode Inspired Theme and SFMono Font for PyCharm
Install Xcode Inspired them and then install SFMono font

I really love the Xcode look and feel. It's subtle and sleek. At WWDC 2016 last year, Apple unveiled a brand new font called San Francisco. The font went on to become the default font in macOS and iOS, replacing Helvetica (which replaced Lucida Sans). On watchOS, a special Compact variant of San Francisco, was used.

Later, Apple introduced yet another variant, a monospaced variant, which I think simply looks fantastic ‚Äì especially on a high-resolution display like the MacBook. It's super elegant and I wanted it to implement it in my PyCharm, which I like but it is pretty uninspiring with ugly code, bolded out brackets, parentheses and strings.

Anyways, you can do it to in three simple steps.

### Step 1 - Install a Xcode-inspired theme for PyCharm

[Download Xcode-Inspired theme here](http://color-themes.com/?view=theme&id=563a1a6b80b4acf11273ae68) and import the jar file into your Pycharm like this <br>

### Step 2: Install SFMono and then replace it in your Pycharm

Surprisingly this font <b>*does*</b> exist on your Macbook but its hidden in your Terminal.app! Here's how to get it

#### Step 2.1 Installing it in your Mac

1. Go to Terminal.app‚Äôs resources folder: Right click the Finder icon in the Dock >> Click ‚ÄòGo to Folder‚Ä¶‚Äô >> Enter this path: /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/Fonts >> Click Go <br>

2. You‚Äôll see a list of fonts in the folder >> Select all of the fonts in the folder. >> Right click on them and click ‚ÄòOpen‚Äô<br>

3. A window will pop-up previewing the font >> Click Install Font.You‚Äôll perhaps get a window that says there‚Äôs problems with the fonts, its no cause of concern, so just install them all! >> Go ahead and click ‚ÄòSelect all fonts‚Äô >> Click ‚ÄòInstall Checked‚Äô >> You‚Äôll get another dialog >> Click ‚ÄòInstall‚Äô

Voila! Font Book will show the new font as installed. You‚Äôll now be able to select the SF Mono font in your editor üôå

Added is a GIF, just in case you hate reading text ;)

#### Step 2.2 - Changing it in your PyCharm IDE

Easy peasy. Just go to your Pycharm Preferences >> Editor >> Colors and Fonts >> Font and change your font to SF Mono üëç.
Note: If you can't see it just close your font book, reopen it to see its there and reopen your Pycharm.


### Step 3: Fine Tune the Look and feel of your IDE 

If you're a nitpicker like me, then you'd like to get rid of ugly bold font's etc. Anyways Go to Editor>Color fonts>Python and change them to what you like (see image)<br>

We have a cool SFMono and Xcode looking IDE. We can happily code now!<br>
